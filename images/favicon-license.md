# Favicon Information

favicon.svg 

is a slightly modified version of a CC-BY-SA-3.0-IT licensed svg file taken from [http://commons.wikimedia.org/](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22_13_-_ITALY_-_Siringa_droga_-_drugs_-_syringes_-_dealing_IT_WIKIPEDIA.svg).

The only modification is the background. It was changed from a rectangle to a circle resulting in favicon.svg. Additionally it was converted from svg to ico & png formats to feed all the different browser specifications.
